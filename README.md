# My NeoVim init.vim, Plugins and Snippets
My init.vim is mostly inspired and based on Jeffrey Way's tutorial [at Laracasts](https://laracasts.com/series/vim-mastery)

It has been augmented to work well with iTerm2 and NeoVim on Mac OS X. It uses [Vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim) to manage vim plugins.

I've also added a handful of simple snippets, largely for HTML, CSS, JS and PHP.
