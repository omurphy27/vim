# My NeoVim Vimrc, Plugins and Snippets
My Vimrc is mostly inspired and based on Jeffrey Way's tutorial [at Laracasts](https://laracasts.com/series/vim-mastery)

---
It has been augmented to work well with iTerm2 and NeoVim.

---
I've also added a handle of simple snippets, largely for HTML, CSS, JS and PHP.
